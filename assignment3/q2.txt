let a = 0, i = N;

while (i > 0) {
    a += i;
    i /= 2;
}


i=N   1st iteration
i=n/2  2nd iteration
i=n/4  3rd iteration
''''' so on 
until i becomes less than or equal to 0.

ex N=16
i=16   1st iteration
i=8    2nd iteration
i=4    3rd iteration
i=2    4th iteration
i=1    5th iteration
i=0    6th iteration

 log2(16)=4
  which is the exponent we raised 2 to get N

  time complexity is  O(log N). (i=i/2)
