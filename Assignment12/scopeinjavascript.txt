1.Global Scope:

*)Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the code, including inside functions and blocks.
*)Global variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords outside of any function or block.
*)Global variables persist throughout the entire runtime of the program.
example:
    var globalVar = 10;
       function foo() {
         console.log(globalVar); // Accessible inside functions
        }
       console.log(globalVar); // Accessible outside functions

2.Local Scope:

*)Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope. They are accessible only within the function or block in which they are declared.
*)Local variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords inside a function or block.
*)Local variables are not accessible from outside the function or block in which they are declared.
example:
     function foo() {
       var localVar = 20;
       console.log(localVar); // Accessible inside the function
    }
    foo();
    console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
