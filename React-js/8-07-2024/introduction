React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook. 

Using React.js offers several advantages over plain JavaScript, particularly when building complex, dynamic user interfaces.

1. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components. Instead of directly   manipulating the real DOM, which can be slow, React updates the virtual DOM first and then efficiently updates the real DOM.

2. React follows a unidirectional data flow (one-way data binding), which helps in managing the state of an application. It makes the data flow predictable and easier to debug.

3. React has a rich ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools that complement it, such as Redux for state management, React Router for routing, and many UI component libraries.

4. With the virtual DOM and reconciliation process, React ensures that only the necessary parts of the DOM are updated.

5. React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, making it easier to build, maintain, and reuse parts of your application.
