  LinkedList :

 *) LinkedList is the dynamic data structure, as we can add or remove 
  elements at ease, and it can even grow as needed.
  
 *)It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference 
  (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic 
  memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations 
  compared to arrays.
  
  example:
  class Node{
  constructor( name , pnum){
   this.name= name
   this.pnum= pnum
   }
  }
let c1 = new Node("vikas",1236549875)
let c2 = new Node("harish",123659874)
c1.next = c2
c1.next.name (it will access the name of c2)
