JOINS:-

*)joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them

*)Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query by specifying how the 
  tables should be connected or related to each other.
  
  Types of joins 
   1.Join or Innerjoin
   2.Left Join (or Left Outer Join)
   3.Right Join (or Right Outer Join)
   4.Self-Join
   5.Multi-Table Join

lets take Example of Netflix database system for all the above join explaination:

tbales in netflix database are:
1. Users
2.Profiles
3.Videos
4.Cast
5.Actors
6.LastWatchHistory 

1.Innerjoin/join:
   *)An inner join returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables
    involved in the join.
   *)It combines rows from two tables based on a related column between them.
    Example:                                       	
     	select Name                              
        from Profiles P                          
        join Users U                             
        ON U.UserId = P.UserId
        Where 	U.UserId>1;

2.Left Join (or Left Outer Join):
  *)A left join returns all rows from the left table (Users) and the matched
    rows from the right table (Profiles).
  *)If there is no match, the result is NULL from the right side.
  Example:
    SELECT Users.UserId, Profiles.Name
    FROM Users
    LEFT JOIN Profiles ON Users.UserId = Profiles.UserId;
	
  
3.Right Join (or Right Outer Join):
 *)A right join returns all rows from the right table (Profiles) and the matched 
  rows from the left table (Users).  
  *)If there is no match, the result is NULL from the left side.
  Example:
    SELECT Users.UserId, Profiles.Name
    FROM Users
    RIGHT JOIN Profiles ON Users.UserId = Profiles.UserId;
	
4.Self-Join:
*)A self-join is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. 
This can be useful when you want to compare rows within the same table,
 or when you want to create hierarchical queries.	
 
 Example:
 SELECT v1.VideoId AS VideoId1, v2.VideoId AS VideoId2
 FROM Videos v1
 JOIN Videos v2 ON v1.VideoId <> v2.VideoId
 AND v1.Description = v2.Description;
 
5.Multi-Table Join: 
  *)A multi-table join involves joining more than two tables together in a
  single query. This can be useful when you need to retrieve data from 
  multiple related tables.
  
  Example:
  
  SELECT p.Name AS ProfileName, v.Title AS VideoTitle, a.Name AS ActorName
  FROM Profiles p
  JOIN WatchHistory wh ON p.ProfileId = wh.ProfileId
  JOIN Videos v ON wh.VideoId = v.VideoId
  JOIN Cast c ON v.VideoId = c.VideoId
  JOIN Actors a ON c.ActorId = a.ActorId;
