   time complexity : amount of time it takes for a program to complete its execution.
   
   space complexity : amount of memory used by a program during its execution.
   
    1. O(1) - Constant Time Complexity
	2. O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
	3. O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity
	4. O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity 
	
	big O notation says 
	1.ignore lower orders terms
	2.ignore  constants
	3.ignore coefficients 
	
	
	ex : time complexity of n^3+n^2+n+1 
	     is 
		 O(n^3)
