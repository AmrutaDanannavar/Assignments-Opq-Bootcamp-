    *)Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit.

    *)Each transaction begins with a specific job and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully completed.

    *)If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure
    
    Example of a transaction to transfer $150 from account A to account B:

    1. read(A)        //let us consider A=1000
    2. A:= A â€“ 150    //1000-150 =850
    3. write(A)       //A=850
    4. read(B)        // let us consider B=50
    5. B:= B + 150    //B=150+50=200
    6. write(B)        //B=200
