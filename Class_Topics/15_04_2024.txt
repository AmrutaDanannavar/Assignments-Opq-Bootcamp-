Joins practice :

use sql_store;

select  *from customers;
select * from orders;

 select first_name,order_id
 from customers s join 
 orders o on s.customer_id = o.customer_id;
 
 use sql_hr;
 
 select * from employees;
 select * from offices;
 
SELECT c.first_name , p.name 
FROM customers c
JOIN orders  o ON c. customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN  order_items oi  ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

select * from products;

 Aggregate functions:

 
 *)Aggregate functions in SQL are functions that perform a calculation on a set of
 values and return a single value. These functions are commonly used with the GROUP BY 
 clause to perform calculations on groups of rows rather than on individual rows
 
 1.COUNT: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition
  ex:
     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM table_name;
	 
 2.SUM: Returns the sum of the values in a column.
   ex:
      SELECT SUM(column_name)
      FROM table_name;
 
 3.AVG: Returns the average of the values in a column.
   ex:
     SELECT AVG(column_name)
     FROM table_name;
	 
 4.MIN: Returns the minimum value in a column.
   ex:
     SELECT MIN(column_name)
     FROM table_name;
	 
 5.MAX: Returns the maximum value in a column.
   ex: 
    SELECT MAX(column_name)
    FROM table_name;
   
   
 Group By Clause : 
 
  The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values 
  into summary rows, typically to apply an aggregate function such as COUNT,
  SUM, AVG, MIN, or MAX to each group
  
  example:
   1.select name,sum(quantity_in_stock)
     from products
     group by name;
	 
   2.SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY customer_id;
