                Having Clause    
                -----*-------
    *)The HAVING clause in SQL is used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups of rows returned by a query based on specified conditions. 
    *)While the WHERE clause filters individual rows before grouping, the HAVING clause filters groups of rows after they have been grouped.

       from products ;

    2) 
    -- for every order status find the count of orders
        select count(order_id) as CountOfOrders
        from orders
        group by status;    

   3)
    -- show total invoices value of client,for only those clients who have more than 2 invoices 
        select client_id, Sum(invoice_total)
        from invoices 
        group by client_id
        having count(invoice_id)>2;                

   4)-- show total Invoice per client
     --  consider only those invoices which have a payment date

        select  o.customer_id ,count(1)
        from orders o 
        join order_items oi
        on o.order_id = oi.order_id
        group by o.customer_id;         

        select O.customer_id,count(OI.quantity) as count 
        from orders O 
        JOIN order_items OI ON O.order_id=OI.order_id
        group by O.customer_id 
        order by count desc limit 1;
